Why was my order not being created

if you're only seeing "Form Submitted!" in the terminal, it means the form is being submitted, but the order creation process isn't proceeding as expected. Here’s a checklist of what might be going wrong and how to fix it:

1. Missing Order Creation Logic:
You’ve got the form submission, but you need to add logic to create the Order and OrderItem entries when the form is submitted.

2. Check if POST Data is Available:
Since you are trying to create an order, make sure you're extracting the required data from the POST request. Add some checks to confirm that the data is being passed correctly.

Changes and Things to Check:
Form Validation:

Make sure the form fields (name, email, address, phone) are being posted correctly.
If they are not available, you should display an error and not proceed with order creation.
Order Creation:

I added logic to create an order and its related order items. After the form is successfully submitted, the cart items will be added to the OrderItem model and the Order will be created.
Cart Clearing:

After the order is successfully created, I added logic to clear the cart and its items. This prevents users from accidentally ordering the same items again.
Redirect to Order Confirmation:

Once the order is created, the user is redirected to an order confirmation page (you need to create this view or template if not done yet).
Debugging:
Check if Form Data is Missing:

Add print statements to check if the form fields are being sent correctly. For example:
python
Copy code
print(f"Name: {name}, Email: {email}, Address: {address}, Phone: {phone}")
Ensure Razorpay Integration is Correct:

If you're not using Razorpay for actual payments right now (just COD), make sure the payment-related logic isn’t interfering.
After making these changes, let me know what error (if any) you encounter or if the order creation starts working!
